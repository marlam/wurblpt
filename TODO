- Cleanups:
  - in GGX, get rid of FresnelSchlick and use real formula instead,
    then remove FresnelSchlick from fresnel.hpp
  - replace cstdio/printf everywhere once std::format is available

- Implement a complete material model for physically-based rendering,
  with an import via ASSIMP (or via the PBR extension of tiny_obj_loader).
  The model could be based on J. Frohne, Material Models for Sensor Simulation,
  Ms Thesis.
